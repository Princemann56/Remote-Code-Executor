# CODEX

CODEX is a Remote Code Executor which lets you execute short code snippets of yours remotely.

## Author

- [@Princemann56](https://github.com/Princemann56)



## Features

- Implemented Code Santization
- For each code run request, a seperate Docker container is created which limits the interference with the host machine.
- Socket has been implemented with rooms, allowing multiple users to come together and code along in different rooms.
- The parameters like Time taken to run the code and Total memory used have been limited, allowing efficient management of resources.
- The code execution happens asynchronously, allowing the server to handle multiple requests at the same time.
